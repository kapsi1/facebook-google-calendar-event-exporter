# Facebook to Google Calendar Exporter

A browser extension that adds an **"Export to Google Calendar"** option to Facebook's event export modal. 

## Features
- Seamless integration with Facebook's "Export Event" dialog.
- Supports light and dark modes.
- Directly opens Google Calendar with pre-filled event details (Title, Date, Time, Description, Location).
- No intrusive permissions (only requires access to `facebook.com`).
- Privacy-focused: All parsing and processing happen locally on your computer.

## Installation

### For Users (Manual Installation)
1. Download the latest release `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/kapsi1/facebook-google-calendar-event-exporter/releases) page.
2. Extract the `.zip` file to a folder.
3. Open your browser's extensions page:
   - **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Edge**: `edge://extensions/`
   - **Opera**: `opera://extensions/`
4. Enable **"Developer mode"** (usually a toggle in the top right corner).
5. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the folder where you extracted the extension.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facebook-google-calendar-event-exporter.git
   cd facebook-google-calendar-event-exporter
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Scripts
- `pnpm run dev`: Build and watch for changes during development.
- `pnpm run build`: Create a production build in the `dist/` folder.
- `pnpm run package`: Build and package the extension into a `.zip` file for distribution.
- `pnpm run test`: Run unit tests for the ICS parser and URL builder.
- `pnpm run lint`: Run Biome for code linting and formatting.

## How it Works
1. When you click **"Export Event"** on a Facebook event, the extension detects the modal and injects a new radio button.
2. If **"Export to Google Calendar"** is selected, the extension:
   - Captures the link to the `.ics` file generated by Facebook.
   - Fetches and parses the `.ics` file locally.
   - Converts the event data into a Google Calendar template URL.
   - Opens the pre-filled Google Calendar page in a new tab.
