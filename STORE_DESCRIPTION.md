Effortlessly export Facebook events directly to Google Calendar with one click. No downloads or manual imports required!

## Detailed Description

**Tired of manually downloading and importing Facebook events?**

Moving your social life from Facebook to your Google Calendar shouldn't be a chore. This extension adds a native-feeling "Export to Google Calendar" option directly into Facebook's event export menu. 

With one click, your event details—including the title, date, time, location, and description—are instantly transferred to a new Google Calendar tab, ready to be saved.

### How it Works
1. Navigate to any Facebook event page.
2. Click the three dots (...) and select **"Export Event"**.
3. Choose the new **"Export to Google Calendar"** option.
4. Hit **"Export"** and watch your Google Calendar open with all the details pre-filled.

### Key Features
* ✅ **Seamless Integration:** Blends perfectly with Facebook's light and dark themes.
* ✅ **Zero Manual Work:** No more downloading `.ics` files and uploading them manually.
* ✅ **Privacy-Focused:** The extension processes all event data locally on your computer. Your data is never sent to our servers.
* ✅ **Smart Precision:** Accurately parses titles, time zones, multi-line descriptions, and locations.
* ✅ **Lightweight & Secure:** Requires minimal permissions (only access to `facebook.com`) and doesn't slow down your browser.

### Why choose this extension?
Unlike other tools that require you to link your accounts or grant access to your entire calendar, this extension acts as a smart bridge. It simply "passes" the information from Facebook to Google, keeping you in total control of what gets saved.

Stay organized and never miss a Facebook event again!
